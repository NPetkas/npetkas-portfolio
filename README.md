# npetkas-portfolio

## Description 

This project was created in order to present a nice, well layed out portfolio that is easily navigatable, readable, and clean. This project demonstrates my knowledge, experience, and design quality I can bring to a project or potential employer. It also hepled me understand the mass amount of design possiblities using CSS, while the importance of having a well structured html to back it up with is fundimental. Through is build, I learned the importance of not having redundant coding in order to eliminate any design flaws or issues down the road.
